# Exploring-Data-Project
We will be using the data in the excel file above. Note that this is renamed as such because the original file had - and matlab doesn't read that as a valid filename, so I made it valid and shortened it.

# To make commits to the code
Click on the file named "Group_4_8_Exploring_Data.m". There should be a pencil icon to the right of your screen. This is the place you click to edit. Once you are done editing the part of the code, scroll to the bottom and click "Commit changes" and you are done. Everytime you contribute to something just put down the contribution on this readme file so it is easier to keep track of.
